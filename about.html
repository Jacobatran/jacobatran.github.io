        <h1>Statement</h1>
        <p>I compose work that concern in augment of human experiences. 
            I am attentive to enhance mankind competencies and the gift of contentment. 
            I desire creation that lead to an expansion of sensibility and provides 
            delights for individualism through merging the gap of digital and reality 
            through unifying art and technology. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The website design, creative thinking and visual arts I created are with the 
          intention to alleviate the pain of frustration and/or to attained amusement. 
        </p>
        <p>These projects range from a simple easy to navigate resourceful website which 
            delivered an honest in-depth tech review to help conscious consumer purchase 
            to the creative thinking behind a user-interface app that would solve the problem 
            for a current affair of food delivery, a high demand service for public needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I am continuing on my journey, I hope to cultivate my discipline to advance 
            humanity from the burden of chaos to a more delightful experience. The work I make 
            will be aligned with the range of organizations that impose those same core values 
            and practices. 
        </p>
